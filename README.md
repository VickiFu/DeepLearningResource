# Deep Learning Resource

## Tutorial
1 Slides and Jupyter notebooks for the [Deep Learning lectures at M2 Data Science Universit√© Paris Saclay](https://github.com/m2dsupsdlclass/lectures-labs)

2 [Keras Example](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/tree/master/examples) from Keras Offical Site.


## Model
1 [Model Zoo](https://modelzoo.co/)

## Tool
1 [GYM](https://gym.openai.com/docs/#getting-started-with-gym) is a toolkit for developing and comparing **reinforcement learning** algorithms. It makes no assumptions about the structure of your agent, and is compatible with any numerical computation library, such as TensorFlow or Theano.
